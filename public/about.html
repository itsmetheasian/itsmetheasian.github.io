<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is William Kong. I was born on May 18th and raised in the Koreatown Area. I'm currently 25 years old. 
  As a little kid, I've always had a passion to help people. No matter where I'd be, I've always found a way to somehow help someone. I went to Middle School at 
  Millikan Middle School and High School at Hollywood Senior High School. At Hollywood High, I was in the Leadership Class for all four years of my high school career. 
  During my time in Leadership I've learned valuable skills such as being able to work with administrators and teacher, work with other team members on tough projects and 
  during my last final year at Leadership I was given the opportunity to become the school president where I lead a class of 40 students through numerous projects and 
  events held at school. </p>

<p>Fast forward now, I've graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry. I am currently attending medical school 
  at the Keck School of Medicine at USC. I'm currently wrapping up my second year and coming up on my third. As I've stated before, I would find anyway to help people and I believe
  becoming a doctor is the best way to do it. Although the hard work and many years of studying might be grueling, the perseverance to finish and to help others is greater. 
</p>

<p>I am also a Los Angeles Police Department Reserve Police Officer. I have been with the deparment coming up on three years now. I started the program in 2021 when coronavirus
  just started. I was attending the academy at night after school and would dedicate time so I could become a police officer. Although I started a path in the medical field,
  I still wanted to become a police officer as well. Being a Reserve Police Officer allows me to come in on a part time basis as I complete my medical studies to help people 
  in the law enforcement aspect. Although it's dangerous the reward of being able to help someone I believe is greater.
